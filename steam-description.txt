Play as a combat medic and join "Strike Force Delta" on a daring pre-dawn assault on a guerilla outpost to rescue a NATO hostage. Choose to play "dark" without night vision (default) and experience thrilling room-clearing, close quarters action, illuminated only by your flashlight and/or chemlights, or equip night vision goggles (in the truck's inventory) and gain the upper hand as you sweep and clear more than a dozen randomly placed enemies! Escort the hostage to the safe house and win the scenario! NOTE: Re-loading autosaves will keep the enemies where they were, so 'Restart' the scenario to reset the enemy positions if you want a fresh challenge.
